"Building a nation where no one sleeps hungry by empowering farmers- the providers."


## Vision
-Indian agricultural industry consists of small farmers who are vulnerable to market fluctuations.
-Some major problems they face are mainly due to lack of proper awareness, less adoption of modern digital ways and gap between farmers and government institutions.
-To cater this there are policies, schemes and laws made by government of India which unfortunately donâ€™t always reach farmer's attention; 
this is where ANRTA comes into the picture - a Web Application that aims to bridge the gap between farmers and government financial institutions by highlighting the beneficial schemes, MSPs and laws; also provides information about weather conditions 
*Hence an attempt at Empowering those who ensure no one sleeps hungry in the nation with worlds largest polpulation -#KISAAN_BHAI !! >>.

## Challenges Faced
-Fetching MSPs from official websites was very tedios as the format was irregular hence couldn't be automated and had to be done manually
-Presenting the schemes in not only general user friendly way but specifically farmer friendly way.
-In order to make website appealing and userfriendly complex reactJS project has been implemented which was quite a piece of work and demanded lot of research and debugging (thanks to stack overflow and mentors)
